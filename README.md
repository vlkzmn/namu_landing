<p>The second version of the landing page for the National Art Museum of Ukraine. According to the technical specifications, only the main page has been implemented; links to other pages are not working.</p>
<h1><a href="https://vlkzmn.github.io/namu_landing/">LIVE DEMO</a></h1>

# Technologies used
<ul>
  <li>HTML5</li>
  <li>CSS3</li>
  <li>Sass (SCSS)</li>
  <li>BEM methodology</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>

# Features Overview
<p>Layout is adaptive and responsive. It works correctly on all screen sizes (mobile, tablet and desktop). Is implemented using the mobile-first approach.</p>
<p>The code is valid HTML5 and CSS3. In order to decrease user load and avoid code duplication, styles are implemented using Sass (SCSS) including advanced features like mixins, extends etc. BEM methodology is used for naming classes. This naming convention makes the code more readable and understandable, helps to avoid naming conflicts and makes the code easier to maintain and reuse.</p>

# In Conclusion
<p>This project aimed to improve my skills in HTML5, CSS3, Sass (SCSS), BEM methodology, JavaScript, responsive and adaptive layout and build the entire landing page positioning elements using all the tools such as flexbox, grid, media queries, etc.</p>

<p>The main challenge was to combine all the knowledge and skills I have acquired so far and implement a landing page from scratch.</p>
